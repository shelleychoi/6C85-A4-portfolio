			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Variable Selection | Score: -2<br><br>
					When I initially graphed out all 50 states, most of them did not show any sort of correlation between abortion rates and number of clinics. I chose to focus on the percent changes instead of the actual number of clinics, which this side of the proposition fit better. Furthermore, they would both be “rates” and can be combined into a bar chart. 
					<br>
					While the number of clinics went up, the number of abortions often went down, and vice versa. I specifically chose examples of states that showed the exact trend that I wanted, but in that selection, I made sure to include a wide variety of states that aren’t just “popular” states. This makes it seem like it was a random sample that I took from the 50 states, by including more “relevant” states like California and Massachusetts alongside “less relevant” states such as Oklahoma. What may not work as well is that some users may see this as “too random” and actually experience a drop in credibility instead of greater credibility. I didn’t necessarily consider other alternatives, as most of the data was already not in my favor, so I had to try to massage out what I wanted by removing “outliers”. 
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Too good to be true | Score: -1.5<br><br>
					Per our discussion in the reading groups, sometimes data that seems too good to be true (where one sees increased abortion rates when increased number of clinics, decreased abortion rates when decreased number of clinics). Thus, in order to prevent this, I added a state that didn’t adhere to this rule (Oregon), but just one so it makes the overall data look credible when in reality, it’s not. I think this is something really tricky that most readers will not catch, and instead believe that the data was chosen intentionally or using random selection. I do wonder if it would’ve been better to throw in two instead of one, but I felt like 5/7 would make the argument weaker than a 6/7 case. While the annotated numbers on each of the bars could add unwanted complexity to the graph, I found that it adds to the reader credibility that the numbers are, in fact, precisely and directly represented from the data. 
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Causality | Score: -1<br><br>
					I’m assuming casuality in the title of this visualization, when in reality, there is probably little correlation in most of these states. Wording is extremely powerful, so instead of writing “There is a correlation between the number of abortion clinics and the abortion rate,” which would’ve been much more subtle, I chose to fully assume casuality. This manipulates the readers in believing causality exists when it does not. For conserative anti-abortion readers who are against funding more abortion clinics, this is a visualization that aptly combines the casuality of these two variables. It is also a direct representation of how I want the readers to perceive and understand the data. 
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Color | Score: -0.5<br><br>
					I purposely chose highly contrasting colors, which not only improves readability but emphasizes the data and draws the focus in. I chose abortion rates to purposely have red, to reflect a more “negative” association of the color. Due to the contrast, you can really tell that both bars of each states goes left and right. Other alternatives, such as pastel colors, doesn’t give off the same kind of confidence as contrasting colors do, so I settled for this option instead. 
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Adding source | Score: 1<br><br>
					Adding a link to the dataset that was used adds more transparency in the process and aids credibility as a result. This is well-intentioned, and allows for cross-referencing for those who are more interested in seeing the data. However, the intention is similar to the “too good to be true” argument earlier; I’m assuming that most users will not, in fact, click on the dataset to read more about it, and just believe that I am being truthful (enough to be confident to post the dataset).

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="./images/against.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: min(65vw, 70em);" />
				<figcaption>
					Higher abortion rates likely due to more state-funded abortions, not due to number of clinics. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Data Selection | Score: -1<br><br>
					In this dataset, there are a variety of variables that represented the number of abortions, number of clinics, and amount of state funding. I looked at ones that represented rates, numbers, different years, and ultimately decided on this combination because it was most representative of the view I wanted to support. By using count, the relationship between abortions and state-funded abortions was much clearer in the visualization. This also meant that we weren’t necessarily tracking increases and decreases, as the first visualization, and were simply commenting on correlation. It also does not assume causality like the other graph, which makes it easier to focus on a combination that highlights the relationship I want.  	
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Variable Selection | Score: -1.5<br><br>
					Similar to the approach above, I purposely chose six “unrelated” and “random” states to represent the 50 states. It seems like a pretty innocuous sample, but I again chose the states that reflect my side of the proposition rather than reflect the whole data. These states exhibit no null values (the number of state-funded abortions was often null), and no zero values either to really highlight that when the number of state-funded abortions was high, the number of abortions was high. This is quite misleading, but again, the readers may be suspicious that there are only six states represented out of 50, so it may not be as misleading as originally intended.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Axis | Score: -1.5<br><br>
					With a regular axis, I realized that the number of clinics and state-funded abortions were too little in comparison to the number of abortions performed. It was thus difficult to visualize the three of them together, as two of the three bars were practically of zero height. As a result, I decided to tweak the y-axis to show the bars more clearly. In doing so, the relationship between abortions and state-funded abortions also become clearer and look stronger. 
					<br>
					I also purposely did not annotate the data in terms of the number of abortions, clinics, and state-funded, as that would very clearly show that something was wrong with the y-axis. I initially tried to truncate the axis, but Tableau does not allow such a function as that is bad practice for data visualization. I ultimately settled for the logarithmic axis instead due to the program I was using, but otherwise I would’ve liked to see a truncated axis in between 10,000 to 50,000 frequency. 
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Color | Score: -0.5<br><br>
					Because I wanted to draw emphasis to the relationship between the number of abortions and state-funded abortions, I chose bright colors for the two. Clinics, which I want to de-emphasize, is given a dull brown color. At first glance, it simply looks like three different colors that are mildly in the same color palette, but it was purposely done to really highlight that more state-funded abortions have a larger correlation with the number of abortions than the number of clinics.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		I was frankly horrified to see just how easy it was to massage the data according to what I wanted. I wasn’t “modifying” the data in any way, as in I wasn’t rewriting or fudging any of the numbers, but even based on seemingly innocuous methods such as variable selection, what exactly was selected (the count number versus the percentage/rate), color, and making sources look more reliable than they are, were so harmful. I’m honestly not sure what to define as ethical analysis and visualization anymore; anything with intent seems to give the author so much power in manipulating. I can only hope that even if everyone has <i>affective intent</i> as we discussed during the reading group, the visualizers will have good conscience and continually check themselves on whether they are purposely choosing misleading methods. Thus, I’m not sure if there are acceptable persuasive choices versus misleading ones; anything done out of ill-will is automatically categorized as misleading. I noticed this when I was scoring each of the design decisions that I made: most of them were scored negatively. This meant that I was clearly aware of the misleading decisions I was making. 
		<br><br>
		That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the steps of my overall design process. I had the most difficulty coming up with two very different views on a singular proposition. I wasn’t sure how I was going to find the right pieces of the data to morph it into two completely different ideas. However, once I had my ideas straight, cherry-picking bits and pieces was quite straightforward, and the design choices came easily afterward. I think this was really a brilliant, albeit hard, exercise that really forced me to come to terms with how easy it is to create a misleading visualization. Now that I understand, I’m very appreciative of in the many, many graphs I will create in my career, I will always be wary of making misleading visualizations and try to be as ethically conscious as possible.
